# Nba Data Analysis

In this project, I applied manipulation, cleaning, analysis and visualization operations on various csv files using pandas, numpy and math plot libraries. The csv files mentioned contained NBA-related game, player, match, team and score information.

During the manipulation phase, I applied operations such as matching the data in different csv files and categorizing the given values. In the cleaning part, I focused on making sense of the NaN data and in the analysis part I focused on making inferences from the data. I have obtained some analyzes as a result of the visuals I have created by using histograms, plotting, pie charts and bar charts.
