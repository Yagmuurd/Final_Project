# Nba Data Analysis

                                                  Description of the Project
                                                                                        
This project contains application of **manipulation, cleaning, analysis and visualization** operations on various csv files using **pandas, numpy and math plot libraries**. The csv files mentioned contained NBA-related game, player, match, team and score information.

During the manipulation phase, you can see the application of operations such as matching the data in different csv files and categorizing the given values. Cleaning part focused on making sense of the NaN data and in the analysis part focused on making inferences from the data. It includes some analyzes as a result of the visuals I have created by using **histograms, plotting, pie charts and bar charts**.
